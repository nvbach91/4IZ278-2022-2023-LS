It delivers everything, from slightly tweaked sounds to massive overdrive in excellent, impressive quality. The ODB-3 covers the entire frequency range of the bass - down to the deep B on a 5-string - so you always have a first class distortion with a clear, transparent sound. With the BALANCE control you can mix the bass and the effect signal to get the brilliance and the pressure of the original sound fully, even in heavy distortion. The ODB-3 overdrive pedal can also be used as a 2-band equaliser (low / high).",
